Notes about Introduction to Cyber Security and Terminologies

Cyber Security Notes
    
The Definition of Computer Security:
Security is a state of well-being of information and infrastructures in which the possibility of successful yet undetected theft, tampering, and disruption of information and services is kept low or tolerable
Security rests on confidentiality, authenticity, integrity, and availability


# Security Layers:

# Security Techniques:
1. Access Control: The access to the data and computer is controlled. If the user misuses the privileges given to her/him then the access to such user is denied.
2. Backup of data: We can secure our data by taking regular backup. We can secure our data by storing another copy of data at another location.
3. Antivirus software: No. of antivirus software are available which provides security to our the system from malicious software.
4. Firewall: Firewall is used to protect internal networks from external attacks. It is acting like a security door to our network
5. Encryption: It is the cryptographic technique used to protect information. There are two methods of encryption symmetric and asymmetric encryptions

# Types of Attacks(Classification)
1. Active Attacks: Active attacks are the type of attacks in which, The attacker efforts to change or modify the content of messages. Due to active attack system is always damaged and System resources can be changed. The most important thing is that, In active attack, Victim gets informed about the attack.

2. Passive Attacks: Passive Attacks are the type of attacks in which, The attacker observes the content of messages or copy the content of messages. Passive Attack is a danger for Confidentiality. Due to passive attack, there is no any harm to the system. The most important thing is that In passive attack, Victim does not get informed about the attack.

# Symmetric Key Encryption
Encryption is a process to change the form of any message in order to protect it from reading by anyone. In Symmetric-key encryption the message is encrypted by using a key and the same key is used to decrypt the message which makes it easy to use but less secure. It also requires a safe method to transfer the key from one party to another.

# Asymmetric Key Encryption
Asymmetric Key Encryption is based on public and private key encryption techniques. It uses two different key to encrypt and decrypt the message. It is more secure than the symmetric key encryption technique but is much slower.
