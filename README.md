# Security Techniques:
1. Access Control: The access to the data and computer is controlled. If the user misuses the privileges given to her/him then the access to such user is denied.
2. Backup of data: We can secure our data by taking regular backup. We can secure our data by storing another copy of data at another location.
3. Antivirus software: No. of antivirus software are available which provides security to our the system from malicious software.
4. Firewall: Firewall is used to protect internal networks from external attacks. It is acting like a security door to our network
5. Encryption: It is the cryptographic technique used to protect information. There are two methods of encryption symmetric and asymmetric encryptions

# Types of Attacks(Classification)
1. Active Attacks: Active attacks are the type of attacks in which, The attacker efforts to change or modify the content of messages.
